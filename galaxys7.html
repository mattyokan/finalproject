                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <article>
                        <p><strong>Here’s the thing about smartphones:</strong>&nbsp;they are a lot better when they have big screens. Virtually everything we do with smartphones is enhanced by a larger display: messaging, playing games, watching video, reading articles, browsing the web, you name it. After all, when it’s stripped down to its core, the modern smartphone is little more than a touchscreen display in front of an ultra-compact, connected supercomputer.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>But in order to have a big screen, you have to put up with a big&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: border-box;">phone</em>, and to be honest, big phones are a pain in the neck. They are clumsy to hold and easy to drop, don’t fit comfortably in our pockets, look ridiculous on your arm when exercising, and are all but impossible to use with one hand. But what if you could have a phone with a big screen&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: border-box;">and</em>&nbsp;be able to comfortably use it in one hand? What if it easily slipped into your pocket, yet still provided an immersive display that was great to watch video or play games on? And what if it still had a big enough battery to power that big display all day long, regardless of how much you used your phone?</p>
                        <p>Samsung is betting it has the answer to all of those questions with its new Galaxy S7 smartphone. The Galaxy S7 is actually two phones: the standard S7 ($650-$695, depending on carrier) and the S7 Edge ($750-$795, depending on carrier). It's the Edge that truly tries to solve the big phone problem using Samsung’s unique curved display technology.</p>
                        <p>The S7 models aren’t hugely different from last year’s Galaxy S6 pair — in fact, they look almost identical. The Galaxy S6s were a watershed moment for Android devices: they were the first ones that could stand next to the iPhone in terms of design, materials, performance, and camera quality. So for the S7, Samsung didn’t rewrite its formula. Instead, it took what was good in the S6, refined and iterated upon it, and produced something much better.</p>
                        <p>And it fits in your pocket.</p>
                        <p>The S7 Edge is the clear standout between the two models (it’s also the one Samsung's advertising will be pushing the most). While the standard S7 is an excellent device in its own right, the Edge is the one that advances in design and usability, and tackles one of the biggest complaints with modern smartphones head on.</p>
                        <p>The result is that the S7 Edge is easily one of the best phones I’ve ever used, and probably the best Android phone you can buy right now.</p>
